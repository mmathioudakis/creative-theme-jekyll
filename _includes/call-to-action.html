                <p class="text-faded">The University of Helsinki offers a <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/programmes/master/data-science">MSc program in Data Science</a> that organizes a <a href="https://courses.helsinki.fi/en/data11004">Data Science Project course</a>. During the course, students work on practical data science projects in small groups, providing prototype data science products for external clients, such as companies or research organizations.</p>
                <p class="text-faded">This form is used to collect project ideas from clients and serves as the initial contact point between the client and the course organizers.</p>
                <p class="text-faded"><b>What you get</b>: A group of skilled and enthusiastic master's level students working on a project related to your interests. You also get in close contact with potential recruits.</p>
                <p class="text-faded"><b>What we expect</b>: Every project should offer a possibility to work on real data, either provided by the client or available as open data. We also expect a responsible contact person who agrees to meet with the group 2-3 times during the course, to provide comments on their plans and final results.</p>
